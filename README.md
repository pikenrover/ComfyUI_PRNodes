# ComfyUI_PRNodes
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) custom nodes for randomizing your favorite txt2img prompts, optionally mixes them together, upscales, and includes relevant metadata to upload to [civitai](https://civitai.com/).

This repo includes two nodes written from scratch (RandomPrompt and RandomPromptMixed) and a few nodes adapted from existing ones to match the inputs and outputs needed for the needs of the example workflows (see workflows folder).
